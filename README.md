# Chaotic_encryption
### Encrypting an image by converting it to text data and then running conventional algorithms might can be a complex task , this project aims at utilising a simple method of image encryption 
### Image pixels are shuffled at sender's side using chaotic maps and keys are shared using ECC algorithm.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Usage
> keygenerator.py is the main function which is performing encryption , in my code i have used logistic map , which is the simplest chaotic map.
> users can use different maps and combinations as per their needs
